# ARCHITECTURE.md

This document defines module boundaries to guide AI-assisted refactoring and serve as a code-review checklist.
When modifying any file, ensure changes stay within the owning module's stated responsibility.

## Module Boundaries

> **Path note**: `src/` contains frontend and shared source; `server/` (root-level) contains the standalone Express server (routes, clients).

## Boundary Rules

- **gateEngine boundary**: Functions named `evaluateGate*`, `evaluateStock`, `computeSignalVerdict`, and related scoring helpers belong here. Do not add data-fetching or order logic.
- **bearEngine boundary**: Functions named `evaluateBear*`, `evaluateInverseGate*`, `evaluateMarketNeutral`, `evaluateIPS`, `evaluateFSS` belong here. Do not mix with bull-market Gate evaluation.
- **kisClient boundary**: All raw KIS REST calls (`kisGet`, `kisPost`, `getKisToken`) must go through this module. No other module may call the KIS API directly.
- **stockService boundary**: All external data fetches for **auto-trading and server-side screener** (Yahoo, DART, Gemini, KIS via proxy, KRX via proxy) originate here. quantEngine must not perform network requests.
- **aiUniverseService boundary**: All external data fetches for **AI-recommendation universe discovery and enrichment** originate here. KIS/KRX direct calls are forbidden — use `googleSearchClient` + `naverFinanceClient` + `krxStockMasterRepo` (the master repo's once-a-day KRX download is the only allowed KRX touchpoint). Auto-trading paths must not import this module.
- **autoTradeEngine boundary**: This is the sole channel for real order execution on the server. Client-side modules must not place live orders when `AUTO_TRADE_ENABLED=true`.
- **multiSourceStockMaster boundary**: AI-recommendation universe must refresh the master via this orchestrator only. Direct calls to `refreshKrxStockMaster()` are forbidden outside the orchestrator and its tests. Shadow DB must only be updated by validated Tier 1 / Tier 2 payloads.
- **diagnostics boundary**: `server/health/diagnostics.ts` is the SSOT for system health snapshot collection. `/health` Telegram cmd and `/api/health/pipeline` HTTP route must import `collectHealthSnapshot()` — they may not duplicate data-gathering. External probes (Yahoo/DART HTTP) belong in `runExternalProbes()` — keep them out of the snapshot core to keep the function pure for testing.
- **MarketModeBanner vs MarketRegimeBanner boundary** (ADR-0018): `MarketModeBanner` is **always rendered** and exposes the trading policy box (`REGIME_TRADING_POLICY` SSOT). `MarketRegimeBanner` is the **alert layer** that only renders during non-BULL or VKOSPI/Inverse Gate alerts. Both stack in `MarketOverviewHeader`. Do not merge — responsibilities differ.
- **DataQualityBadge vs ConfidenceBadge boundary** (ADR-0018): `ConfidenceBadge` shows the **single price source** (REALTIME/YAHOO/AI/STALE). `DataQualityBadge` shows the **27+1 condition source mix count** (computed/api/aiInferred). Both coexist on stock cards — no merge.
- **GateStatusCard vs GateStatusWidget boundary** (ADR-0018): `GateStatusCard` is the **compact read-only** version embedded in WatchlistCard (no expand/interaction). `GateStatusWidget` is the **full expandable** version inside StockDetailModal. Do not unify with prop modes — interaction code in card would balloon LoC.
- **REGIME_TRADING_POLICY SSOT**: All future code that maps `RegimeLevel` to allowed/forbidden trading strategies must import from `src/types/ui.ts`. Do not duplicate the 6-level table elsewhere.
- **exitEngine boundary** (ADR-0028): `server/trading/exitEngine.ts` is a barrel re-export only. All logic lives under `server/trading/exitEngine/`. Adding a new exit rule = create `rules/<name>.ts` exporting an `async (ctx: ExitContext) => Promise<ExitRuleResult>` + add to `EXIT_RULES_IN_ORDER` in `index.ts`. Rule files may NOT import other rule files — shared logic goes through `helpers/*`. The `_exitRunning` mutex (PR-6 #12) lives in `index.ts` only.

## Planned Decompositions (advisory)

The following files currently exceed `scripts/check_complexity.js` thresholds. Their
planned decomposition is documented in `docs/adr/`. Until migration completes, the
current file continues to own the listed responsibility above.

| File | Lines | ADR | Planned sub-modules |
|------|------:|-----|---------------------|
| `server/trading/signalScanner.ts` | 1,820 | [ADR-0001](./docs/adr/0001-signalScanner-decomposition.md) | `signalScanner/{index,preflight,candidateSelect,perSymbolEvaluation,approvalQueue,scanDiagnostics}` |
| `server/telegram/webhookHandler.ts` | 1,700 | TBD (P1) | — |
| `server/screener/stockScreener.ts` | 1,571 | TBD (P1) | — |
| ~~`server/trading/exitEngine.ts`~~ | 18 (barrel) | [ADR-0028](./docs/adr/0028-exitEngine-decomposition.md) ✅ | `exitEngine/{index,types,helpers/*,rules/*}` 분해 완료 (PR-53) |

When implementing a decomposition, follow `.claude/skills/server-refactor-orchestrator/SKILL.md` 6-Phase flow and update this table.
